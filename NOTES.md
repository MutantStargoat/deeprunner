 - Using a BSP for level collisions would make it easy to find distance from
   the nearest wall, for sphere/wall collisions which would automatically keep
   the correct distance.

 - With the current raycast collisions, I could approximate beam casting with a
   certain radius, by casting 5 rays from the vertices of the inscribed
   pentagon.

 - Lightmaps + dynamic lights for walls, dynamic lights for other entities.
